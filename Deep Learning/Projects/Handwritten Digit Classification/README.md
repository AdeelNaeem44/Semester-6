# Handwritten Digit Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The objective is to develop an accurate digit recognizer that can be used in applications like automated form processing and digit recognition in banking systems.

##  Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  - tensorflow / keras
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Preprocess the data by normalizing pixel values and reshaping images.
3. Build and compile a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
4. Train the model using training data and validate its performance.
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy and loss metrics.
6. Use the trained model to predict handwritten digits on new images.

## Advantages
- High accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.
